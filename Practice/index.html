      <h1>Disney's Frozen Facts</h1>
      <p>
        The film is based on “The Snow Queen,” a fairy tale written by the prolific Hans Christian Andersen who also wrote The Little Mermaid, and Thumbelina. 
        Frozen was the first Disney feature to be directed and written by a woman (Jennifer Lee, who wrote the film and shares a co-director credit with Buck).
        Animators also created a snowflake generator program to build 2,000 different snowflake shapes that they could use for the film. Rumor has it that they then had to create another program to create a safe space for each of those special  snowflakes.
